/**
 * {@code !lamp} - preview a street lamp where you are standing, and print the exact
 * coordinates so they can be written into the permanent table.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   !lamp            list the lamps, with their ids
 *   !lamp &lt;id&gt;       drop that lamp at your feet and print its coordinates
 *   !lamp clear      remove every preview lamp from this map
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This is {@code !pos} with a lamp attached. It reports the same position that
 * {@code !pos} does, and it sends THAT SAME POSITION to the client to draw with, so the
 * lamp you are looking at stands exactly where the printed numbers say. Reading the
 * position on the client instead would let the two drift by however far the player moved
 * between the command and the packet, which would quietly poison the table.
 *
 * <p>The client snaps the lamp's feet to the foothold under x, exactly as a permanent
 * lamp is snapped, so y only has to be roughly right - what matters is that it picks the
 * same floor. Standing on the floor you want is enough.
 *
 * <p>Previews are client-side and temporary: they live in the client's cached field
 * property and are gone on restart. Nothing is written to the database or to WZ.
