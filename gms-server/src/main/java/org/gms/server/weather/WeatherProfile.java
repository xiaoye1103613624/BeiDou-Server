/**
 * A named sky. Replaces the three independent scalars the first cut used.
 *
 * <p>The old model was a night level, a cloud alpha and a rain alpha, plus a snow toggle.
 * That cannot express a COHERENT sky: a storm is not just rain, it is rain plus heavy
 * cloud plus a colder tint plus a slower fade, and there was nowhere to say so. Every
 * later feature is a table keyed on a profile, so this had to come first.
 *
 * <p><b>Only the ID and the name live here.</b> The server has no opinion about what a
 * storm LOOKS like: the render parameters (tint, cloud and rain alpha, native particle
 * effect, fade rate, sound) are the client's, in
 * {@code client/weather_profiles.inc}. What the two ends must agree on is this
 * numbering, and nothing but this comment enforces that.
 *
 * <p>0, 1 and 2 are deliberately the old {@code SKY_CLEAR}, {@code SKY_RAIN} and
 * {@code SKY_SNOW} values, so the wire format did not change and no saved state or
 * in-flight packet was invalidated by the refactor.
