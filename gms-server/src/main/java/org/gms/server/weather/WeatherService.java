/**
 * The world's sky: what time of day it is, and what is falling out of it.
 *
 * <p><b>The clock is not a counter.</b> {@link #minuteOfDay()} is a pure function of
 * {@code System.currentTimeMillis()}, which buys three things for free: it survives a
 * reboot without any persistence, every world and every channel agrees without any
 * synchronisation, and there is no drift to correct. Nothing here has to tick for the
 * clock to be right; the recurring task exists only to broadcast, to re-roll the
 * weather, and to keep clients from drifting between packets.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately NOT {@code Server.getCurrentTime()}: that value is advanced by a
 * constant 777 ms per disease tick and only re-pinned to wall time every five minutes,
 * so it can jump backwards. A day/night phase derived from it would stutter.
 *
 * <p><b>The sky is SERVER-WIDE, not per world.</b> This state is static while
 * {@link org.gms.net.server.task.WeatherTask} is registered once per world, so N worlds share one
 * sky. That is deliberate: the brief was that every player experiences the same weather
 * simultaneously, and a per-world sky would mean two players in the same guild seeing
 * different rain. The consequence is that N world timers all call {@link #rollIfDue()},
 * so that method has to be safe against concurrent callers, which is what the
 * compare-and-set on {@code nextRollAt} is for: exactly one caller per interval wins the
 * roll and the rest observe the result.
 *
 * <p>To make weather per world instead, key these three fields by world id and give
 * {@link org.gms.net.server.task.WeatherTask} its {@code wserv.getId()}; nothing else changes.
 *
