/**
 * LP_WeatherSync (0x373D): the world's sky state, for {@code client/weather.cpp}.
 *
 * <p>The v83 client has no day/night system and no concept of world weather, so every
 * byte here is a side channel. The packet is a RE-SYNC, not a tick: the client advances
 * its own clock between packets using {@code msPerGameMinute}, so dropping one only
 * costs a little drift.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   short  opcode            0x373D
 *   short  minuteOfDay       0..1439, in-game minutes past midnight
 *   int    msPerGameMinute   real ms per in-game minute (how fast the client advances)
 *   byte   sky               WeatherService.SKY_*
 *   byte   flags             bit0 = snap (do not fade; used on map entry)
 *   int    skyElapsedSec     how long this sky has held, for ground accumulation
 *   byte   tintR             the region's night colour, as a multiply against the art
 *   byte   tintG
 *   byte   tintB
 *   short  rainbowSecsLeft   seconds of after-the-rain rainbow still owed, 0 for none
 *   byte   palette            client-owned dusk/night palette id
 *   int    skyElapsedMs       exact sky age, for synchronized cosmetic lightning
 *   int    skyToken           random seed for that individual sky occurrence
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Twenty-eight bytes including the opcode. Broadcast once a minute per world plus once on every map entry, so the
 * shape is deliberately fixed-size with no strings and no counts: the client decoder
 * needs no bounds loop and a truncated packet can only produce clamped garbage for one
 * frame.
 *
 * <p><b>Opcode equality with the DLL is enforced by nothing but this comment.</b>
 * {@code client/weather.cpp} must use 0x373D. 0x373C is reserved as its recv twin
 * under the house even-request / odd-reply convention, and is currently unused: the
 * client never asks for weather, it is only told.
 *
 * @see WeatherService
 * @see org.gms.net.server.task.WeatherTask
