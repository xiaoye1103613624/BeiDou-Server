/**
 * Where in the world a map is, for the purpose of what falls out of its sky.
 *
 * <p>Weather used to be one value for the whole world. It is now rolled per region, so
 * El Nath can be snowing while Henesys is clear. <b>The client needed no change for
 * this</b>: it renders whatever sky byte it is handed, so "regional weather" is entirely
 * a question of which byte each player is sent, and players are told their own map's sky
 * on entry and on every broadcast.
 *
 * <h2>Keyed on the map id prefix</h2>
 *
 * Map ids are structured, and the leading digits are the area. Verified against
 * String.wz/Map.img:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   101  Ellinia          102  Perion           103  Kerning City
 *   104  Lith Harbour     105  Sleepywood       110  Florina Beach
 *   120  Nautilus         140  Rien             200  Orbis
 *   211  El Nath          220  Ludibrium        221  Ludibrium (Eos, Helios)
 *   222  Ludibrium (Omega Sector, Korean Folk Town)
 *   230  Aqua Road        240  Leafre           250  Mu Lung
 *   251  Herb Town        260  Ariant           261  Magatia
 *   680  Amoria           801  Showa
 *
 *   800000000  Mushroom Shrine, ONE map
 * </pre>
 *
 * Mushroom Shrine is the one entry that is an exact id rather than a prefix, because it
 * is a single map rather than an area.
 *
 * The client classifies maps by their background ART bank instead, which is a better key.
 * That table does not exist server side, and porting it here would be a lot of machinery
 * for no gain, so the id prefix is used. Where two prefixes are visually one place, as
 * with Ludibrium's three, they simply share a row.
