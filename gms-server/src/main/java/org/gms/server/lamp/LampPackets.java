/**
 * LP_LampPreview (0x373F): put a lamp on the client's map, where the player stands.
 *
 * <p>This is a placement TOOL, not a game feature. Lamps that ship are compiled into
 * {@code g_aManualLamps} in {@code client/lamps.cpp}; the point of the preview is to
 * find the coordinates to put there. The command prints the same numbers it sends, so
 * what you see standing in the map is exactly what gets written into the table.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   short  opcode   0x373F
 *   byte   mode     0 = place a lamp, 1 = clear every preview on this map
 *   byte   lamp     index into LampCatalog, which is generated from the same table
 *                   as the client's kLamps. Ignored when clearing.
 *   int    mapId    map that was current when the command was executed
 *   int    x        world x, from the server's own view of the player
 *   int    y        world y; the client snaps the lamp to the foothold under x
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Sixteen bytes including the opcode -- 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 -- fixed size in both
 * modes: the clear still carries the unused lamp and
 * position so the client decoder has one length to check rather than a branch before it
 * knows what it is reading.
 *
 * <p>The COORDINATES COME FROM THE SERVER rather than being read on the client, so the
 * lamp the player sees and the numbers printed to chat cannot disagree - which is the
 * entire value of the tool.
 *
 * <p>The preview is not persisted anywhere. It lives in the client's cached copy of the
 * field property, so it survives walking around and disappears when the client is
 * restarted or the property is re-read.
 *
 * <p><b>Opcode equality with the DLL is enforced by nothing but this comment.</b>
 * {@code client/integration/packetdispatcher.cpp} must use 0x373F. 0x373E is reserved as its recv
 * twin under the house even-request / odd-reply convention and is unused.
 *
 * @see LampCatalog
