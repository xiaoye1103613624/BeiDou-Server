/**
 * Keeps every client in the world looking at the same sky.
 *
 * <p>Two jobs, and only the second one is strictly necessary:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Re-roll the weather when it is due (suspended while a GM override holds).</li>
 *   <li>Re-broadcast the state, so client clocks cannot drift apart.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The day/night phase itself needs no ticking at all: it is a pure function of wall
 * time on both ends (see {@link WeatherService#minuteOfDay()}). This task exists because
 * WEATHER is stateful and because a client that missed a packet should not stay wrong
 * for a whole session. Twenty-eight bytes per player per minute.
 *
 * <p>Runs on a {@code TimerManager} worker. That pool has four threads shared by every
 * recurring task in the process, so this must stay cheap: it does no I/O, takes no lock,
 * and the per-player send is already individually guarded inside
 * {@link WeatherPackets#broadcast}.
